This is a fork of the BlowfishJ project on SourceForge, that you may find here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/blowfishj/

## What is BlowfishJ?

This is my own implementation of the Blowfish encryption algorithm in ECB and CBC mode. It's a simple to use package and runs at an excellent speed, around 40 Mb/s with the Hotspot Server VM of the JDK 1.4 on a P4/1700. The code actually comes very close to the limits what is possible with Java. The latest JDK it was tested on is 1.4.2_05-b04. Stream and string encryption solutions are compatible to Blowfish.NET (a C# implementation), allowing an easy data exchange between Java and the Microsoft.NET platform.

Next to the original sources this software also includes streaming classes originally contributed by Dale Anson <danson@germane-software.com>.

For one of the real world application using BlowfishJ please check out John's Zaurus JCryptPad at

Thanks to Siegfried Goeschl <siegfried.goeschl@it20one.at> BlowfishJ became an official project at Sourceforge and is buildable via Maven/Ant. You can find our project at:

## Version history 

### 2.16

- using Git/GitHub instead of CVS/SourceForge
- upgraded to Maven 2.x
- upgraded to JUnit 4.12
- little refactorings

### 2.15

- removed unused local variables, which were detected by the JDK 1.5 compiler
- streams can now be closed multiple times without causing problems
- some copyright/comment and demo code adjustments
- verified to compile and run in the new Eclipse 3.1 IDE

### 2.14

- root package names changed to (test.)net.sourceforge.blowfishj
- project is now hosted at Sourceforge, see above
- updated to Apache License 2.0
- added Maven build

### 2.13

- fixed a bug in the key setup of BlowfishECB, if keys were passed with an offset and they were smaller than Blowfish.BLOCKSIZE then the overall 56 byte key used was wrongfully assembled; a test case was added to prove the fix

### 2.12

- switch to Apache/BSD license (BlowfishJ is now a candidate for Jakarta)
- deprecated constructor in BlowfishSimple, introduced a better solution using the full Unicode data (be aware that the constructors are _not_ compatible!)
- added known weak key test
- added demo code for BlowfishEasy
- added compatibility tests for data exchange with Blowfish.NET
- removed the C++ sources (this project fell behind its expectations)

### 2.11

- added comments for each deprecated item
- added BUILD.BAT for auto-generation of docs, jar and class files (Win32 only)
- some bugs in the Javadoc comments

### 2.10

- instances (of ECB and CBC) can be reused by invoking initialize()
- added a JUnit test suite
- renamed BlowfishTest to BlowfishTest) and moved it to the test package
- moved InOutputStreamTest to the test package
- renamed SHA1Test to SHA1Demo and moved it to the test package 
- changed the benchmark to CBC/bytes encryption (closer to the real world)
- refactored the streams (e.g. deprecated the string consuming ctors)
- problem with streams: zero length content generated incompatible output
- bug with input stream: IV reading could fail for no reason
- renamed some methods in BinConverter (their names simply didn't make sense)
- general code cleanup and some minor speedups (yet outside of the hot spots)

### 2.02

- added Eclipse 2.1 project files
- removed deprecated method calls and obsolete imports
- reformatted all Java source code (e.g. to fit print margins)
- BlowfishJ is now published under the LGPL

### 2.01

- problem BlowfishCBC, only the first block got decrypted (wrong block swaps)
- BinConverter.binHexToBytes was flawed

### 2.00

- speed optimized the byte array handling methods (since they are the most commonly used), which gained around 50% more performance(!); both ECB and CBC classes now have separated inner loops for maximum speed
- all methods with array parameters have now new versions with offset and length parameters (where necessary), solves lots of data copying overhead for the caller
- also deprecated all of these old methods with array parameters
- extended and cleaned up BinConverter
- BlowfishEasy is now using the standard Java SHA-1 implementation
- fixed message input in BlowfishTest (length adjustment)

### 1.86

- added BlowfishJ implementation in C++
- decryption was referencing the box members, not the references on the stack, which lead to a decrease in performance

### 1.85
